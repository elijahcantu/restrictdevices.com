        <div class="accordion-body"> Unfortunately, on 2024-06-27, after about 7 years of accepting emails from this
          server, gmail.com started to block all email from lockbox.pluckeye.net (!!!), so you cannot register an
          account using that email address. Yes, Gmail recently started to block lockbox account creation emails not
          because we have ever sent an email that a Gmail user has marked as spam, nor because we do not have SPF or
          DKIM configured correctly, nor because our forward-reverse DNS IP lookup is askew, nor because we have not
          verified our domain with Gmail postmaster tools (we have), but because our servers send ... wait for it ...
          TOO LITTE email. How silly is that?!! How much longer can services such as this one exist when major email
          providers act this way? The stupidist part of this is that those who run email deliverability services
          frequently embed tracking measures into their emails, such as 1x1 pixels or use unique hyperlink tracking so
          they know whether you, lowly peasant, have read the very important emails they send. In other words, they spy
          on you. We refuse to support a service that offers pixel tracking or other techniques to track / spy on the
          naive recipients of such email who do not know that the person who sent the email knows whether it has been
          opened or whether or not their click-baity links have been clicked. Do we recommend another service?
          Personally, we PAY for our email (we use fastmail.com), but even with fastmail.com we had to forcibly disable
          all spam filtering because bounce emails sent by Microsoft in reply to messages by our own servers were sent
          to our Spam folder. For those who know, these were BOUNCE messages addressed to postmaster that Fastmail said
          could be backscatter because the email was not sent through their servers. And they did not want us to send
          email through their servers either. WTF, people?! Is there no way to send emails in 2024 other than to succumb
          to the semi-corrupt email service provider clique? For email, who do we recommend? Microsoft? No. Apple? No.
          Google? No. Zoho? No. A privacy oriented service such as Proton Mail? We (or rather, I) do not much care for
          their marketing. Tutanota? No! What then? We do not have a clue! But we think whatever it is, you should pay
          money for email and stop using the free services because the free services all seem to suck in the same way:
          they require the world contain a small number of email sending services that give each other money for the
          privilege of being able to send email (and often spy on the poor suckers who use their services). Perhaps they
          suck in part because they are built on top of models that take advantage of you, or perhaps because they lack
          the funds to fight all those across the world dead set on sending spam. Probably they are doing their best. It
          is unfortunate that means we can no longer send you email from this server. :-( </div>
