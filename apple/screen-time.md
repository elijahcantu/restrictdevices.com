## Screen Distance
Click on Screen Distance.  
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/26.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Enable Screen Distance to get a popup to move your iPhone or iPad at least 1 foot away from your face when it is too close.  
## Communication Safety

<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/35.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Enable Communication Safety to blur images and videos that are received on this device that are detected as innapropriate.  
The user can still click on the image to unblur it, but will first receive a popup with guidance on such material.  
A popup also appears on detected iamges before the user sends one on the device.  
It is not perfect, it wrongly detected a shirtless gym picture I sent (I am a male).  
## Content & Privacy Restrictions
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/48.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Enable Content & Privacy Restrictions to apply settings.  
### App Installations & Purchases

Prevent installing new apps (prevents app updates though) all together or from different sources.  
Disable in-app purchases or require the password of the iCloud account signed into the device.  
Prevent deleting any apps.  
### Allowed Apps & Features
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/41.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
You can disable built-in apps and features on the device.  
For example, you can disable the camera, which will also disable FaceTime and in-app cameras, or you can just disable FaceTime.  
### Store, Web, Siri & Game Center Content
You can apply restrictions to store content, web content, siri, and game center.  
#### Allowed Store Content

## Lock Screen Time Settings
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/50.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Click on Lock Screen Time settings.  
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/51.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Set a screen time passcode.  
I recommend setting a temporary one to make sure all of your settings are applied properly first.  
If you are setting it for yourself, ask a friend to set one for you or position your hand a weird way above the screen, look away and type a random passcode.  
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/52.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Re-enter the passcode.  
### Recovery Apple Account
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/53.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Enter a recovery Apple Account in case you forget the screen time passcode.  
If you are setting it for yourself, make another Apple Account using a friend's phone number if possible.  
Set a random password for the account and store the credentials in a <a href="https://lockbox.pluckeye.net/" target="_blank">Plucky Lockbox</a>.  
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/62.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Once you enter the recovery account, click OK.  
#### Change Recovery Apple Account
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/54.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
If you click Cancel and Skip, the user will be able to reset the screen time passcode using the Apple Account signed into the device.  
Click provide apple account and use your own if you are setting it up for someone else or another account as noted above for yourself.  
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/56.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
If you hit Cancel and Skip already, click Change Screen Time Passcode.  
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/57.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Then click Turn Off Screen Time Passcode. This will enable the recovery account prompt again when you click Lock Screen Time settings and enter a new passcode.   
### Block at Downtime & End of Limit
Once you set a Screen Time passcode you will be able to block at downtime and end of limit.  
#### Downtime
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/67.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Go to Downtime and enable Block at Downtime.  
You will need to enter the screen time passcode to disable down time now.
#### App Limit
<img class="iphone" src="/assets/images/screen-time/70.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy">  
Go to an App Limit and enable Block at End of Limit.  
This will block the apps and websites for this individual limit after it runs out.  
You will need to enter the screen time passcode when trying to access these apps and websites after the limit runs out.
